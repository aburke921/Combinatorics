#counting phylogenetic ancestors
#combinatorics 9

#when you look at any phylogenetic tree like the ones being given it is important 
#   to note that the internal nodes are always n-2
#this occurs if you look at any example

#i spent way to long trying to program this before realizing that this happens everytime so i think it should be ok to just have this but im not entirely sure

n = 80
output = n-2
print(output)
